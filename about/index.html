		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hi. My name is Garrett Brown, but I go by Dan Gero online. My favorite hobbies are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<details>
					<summary>music production;</summary>
					<p>If I was made to guess, I'd say that I've been involved in music production on and off since 2015. I started out messing around with a program called <a href="http://www.andrelouis.com/qws/">QWS</a>, but later moved on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GarageBand">Garage Band</a> shortly after receiving a Mac Book Air for my 16th birthday. Around 2019-2020, I switched to using <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a> on Windows, which is what I've been using to this day.</p>

					<summary>vocal synth production;</summary>
					<p>I suppose this technically falls under music production, but considering the scope of the hobby, I chose to make it a separate bullet point. Vocal synths, for the uninitiated, are basically computer-generated singers. When dedicated singing synthesizers came out, they originally used a bunch of human voice sounds that get strung together to make them sing the appropriate sounds, but nowadays, we have AI-generated singers as well. I'm over simplifying it here though, because this page is about me.
					I started using a program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a> on August 2, 2022. No, I don't remember the date by heart. I know this date because I still have the first project I ever created on my computer. Anyway, as you can probably imagine, I wasn't particularly good at using Vocaloid when I first started out. What may surprize a lot of people is how quickly I learned the program. By August 8, I learned a majority of the program's features and how to use them. I knew how to work with Vocaloid. Within 3 months, I was able to master the entire program, including all the subtle tricks that made the voices sound better. I knew how to make Vocaloid work for me. In December of 2023, I also began learning how to use one of those AI programs I mentioned above (<a href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Synthesizer V</a>) and figured it out in about a week.
					I know; I'm bragging. I have a good excuse for that though. You see, I have a lot of hobbies, but this particular hobby took the least amount of time for me to master. It also took me less time to master Vocaloid than it did for many of the fantastic producers we've got now. You also have to remember that I am blind, and when it comes to information about Vocaloid and vocal synth technology in the blind community in terms of how well we can use it, there's not a whole lot of public knowledge about the subject. In fact, it saddens me that I might be the only blind person in the world who knows as much about vocal synth technology usage as I do, and I worry every day what's going to happen to that information when I'm gone. But don't worry. I'm not special, and I don't believe I am special or better than anyone else. I'm just very proud of how quickly I was able to learn this particular hobby, because it's one of the few hobbies I think I'm really good at and have confidence in.</P>

					<summary>writing;</summary>
					<p>Writing is something I have never taken seriously, and it's not something I'm particularly talented in. I kind of just do it when I feel like it. I learned how to do it decently by posting on forums and social media all the time, and mandatory English classes in schools of course. Most of the time, I'm writing things like this website, forum posts, social media posts, text messages, and other boring things of that nature. However, there are occasions where I decide I want to try my hand at writing a story. Every story I have written has either remained unpublished, uncompleted, or both unpublished and uncompleted. I have worked on fanfiction, auto biographies, comedy sketches, and screen plays, all of which are my own, and none of which have been published. Most of them will probably never be published, mainly because they're written for my enjoiment only.</p>

					<summary>voice acting;</summary>
					<p>This hobby is conflicting for me, because it's something I considered persuing as a career. Unfortunately, it is a hobby I am meerly decent at, because the fact is I don't practice much. Between my other hobbies and my goals, I simply haven't found time for it recently. I have released a lot of fake commercials between 2017 and now, but I want to redo a lot of those, because there were some oddities in the way I chose to voice some of the characters in those commercials. I was rellitively new when I recorded them, and as such, I didn't fully know what I was doing. But when I find time to do it, voice acting is definitely something I enjoy.</p>

					<summary>messing with AI;</summary>
					<p>What can I say? It's a lot of fun. Most people have an AI phobia, and while I understand the reason why, I feel like it's largely overexagerated. Sure, AI can be used to do a lot of bad things, but it can be used for good as well. I can use a hammer to wack someone over the head, but I could also use it for its intended purpose of driving nails into objects to hold them in place. I do have an issue with the way some of these tools are built, but that's a discussion meant for another place.</p>

					<summary>wasting time talking to friends and browsing social media;</summary>
					<p>I talk far too much. If you want to fuel my habbet of talking too much, you can reach me via one of my chosen platforms under the socials heading.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
				<li>
					<details>
					<summary>long walks on the beach.</summary>
					<p>Actually, this last one is a joke. I have a weakness to heat, and walking for a prolonged period of time tires me out. ðŸ™‚</p>
				</details>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Something that seems to surprise a lot of people about me is the fact that I am blind. Technically I would be refered to by most people as visually impaired, because I can see lights and shadows. However, since that is all I can see, the vision I do have is mostly useless. Because of that, I call myself blind.
		The reason people are surprized is because, even in 2024, a lot of them still don't know that blind people are capable of using technology of any kind. Alass, I absolutely can. I can do almost everything sighted people can do, thanks to a nifty invention called a screen reader. And the fact is, I'm nobody special. Thousands of blind people do most of the things I do every single day.
		Unfortunately, not everything is a walk in the park for us. You see, developers have to put in the effort to make their application accessible to screen readers. A lot of developers do put in the effort, or they use certain libraries in their applications that take care of the screen reader accessibility part for them. There are a lot of developers, however, who don't make their programs accessible for us. This is usually because, A, the developer works for a company that doesn't really care about us, or B, because they are an indi developer who don't know how to do it. Case in point, I use a program called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a>. This program is not fully usable with screen readers, so I've had to find inventive ways around the problem. I could name a few more examples, but seeing as this page is about me, I'll save those examples for another place.
		To be finished later.</p>
